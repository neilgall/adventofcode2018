# Hello

It's Advent of Code time again. After completing all of last years' in
Haskell I've been unsure which language to use this time. I considered
doing it in a language I barely know, to try to learn more, but I feel
Advent of Code is about pure computation technique - how you *think*
about a problem more than how you implement it. In my day job we took
a decision recently to write new code in Kotlin so I'm going to do AoC
this year in Kotlin, *without an IDE* so I'm really forced to learn the
language and libraries rather than hunting and picking from autocomplete
suggestions. I'm using syntax highlighting only and simple bash build
scripts.
