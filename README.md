# Hello

It's [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) time again. After completing all of last years' in
Haskell I've been unsure which language to use this time. I considered
doing it in a language I barely know, to try to learn more, but I feel
Advent of Code is about pure computation technique - how you *think*
about a problem more than how you implement it. In my day job we took
a decision recently to write new code in Kotlin so I'm going to do AoC
this year in Kotlin, *without an IDE* so I'm really forced to learn the
language and libraries rather than hunting and picking from autocomplete
suggestions and relying on Gradle magic. I'm using syntax highlighting
only and the command-line compiler with a Makefile.

## Solutions
* [Day1](src/day1/)
* [Day2](src/day2/)
* [Day3](src/day3/)
* [Day4](src/day4/)
* [Day5](src/day5/)
* [Day6](src/day6/)
* [Day7](src/day7/)
* [Day8](src/day8/)
