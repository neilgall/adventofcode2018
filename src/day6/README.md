# Day 6

I'm starting to see what's going on here. The elves of 1518 have
somehow procured a future [book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming)
of classic programming algorithms. Today there was a little distraction
in problem description around infinite spaces and equidistant points,
but it boils down to a pixel fill algorithm. If you ever worked on a
classic 1980s-90s style paint program you'll recognise it.
